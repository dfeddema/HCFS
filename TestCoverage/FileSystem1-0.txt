Files (x denotes irrelevant test for FS. Its important to separate abstract FS tests from impl specific tests)

x AccumulatingReducer.java			
 TestDU.java		Validates Hadoop FS DU works properly		
 TestGlobPattern.java	Validates Glob Pattern Matching Support		
 DFSCIOTest.java	Why do we have this AND TestDFSIO ?			

 TestDisableCache.java	Validates the ability to turn FS caching on and off 			
 TestHarFileSystem.java	Validates HAR Support http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop_archives.html	(Is this impl specific?)	

 DistributedFSCheck.java Validates 	FS Consistency 				
x TestFSMainOperationsLocalFileSystem.java	Does Nothing we should delete (at least out of the FS Library)	
x TestHardLink.java	Does not use FS. We should remove. Validates Single and Multi File Hard linking

 FSMainOperationsBaseTest.java	Validates FS Operations. Needs to be disambiguated from FileSystemContractBaseTest	
 TestFileSystem.java	Validates Reads, Seeks and Writes via a M/R Job. Needs to be disambiguated from DFSCIOTest and TestDFSIO			
x TestLocalDirAllocator.java	Does not use FS. This is a LocalFileSystem test.		

 FileSystemContractBaseTest.java	Validates FS Impl adherence to FS Contract			
x TestFileSystemCaching.java	Does not use FS. This is a LocalFileSystem test.		
x TestLocalFileSystem.java	Does not use FS. This is a LocalFileSystem test.				

 FileSystemTestHelper.java	Helper/Utility Class for FS Testing		
x TestFileUtil.java		Does not use FS. This is a LocalFileSystem test.		
x TestLocalFileSystemPermission.java	Does not use FS. This is a LocalFileSystem test.

 IOMapperBase.java	Not sure where this is used. Seems redundant.		
 TestFsShellReturnCode.java	Validates that chmod, chown, chgrp returning correct exit codes	
 TestPath.java		I think this is a Helper class for testing Paths. Seems to be a mix of local and (perhaps) FS Tests.			

 TestChecksumFileSystem.java	Does not use FS. This is a ChecksumFileSystem/InMemoryFileSystem test.	
 TestGetFileBlockLocations.java	Validates the ability to determine Block/File Locations	
 TestTrash.java	Validates FS support of Trash Operations
 TestCopyFiles.java	Test Copy Operations but needs to be disambiguated from FileSystemContractBaseTest and other FS Classes.			
x TestGlobExpander.java		Helper class for Glob Operations. Not clear who uses it.			
 TestTruncatedInputBug.java	Test for HADOOP-1489. Needs to be changed from Explicit Local to FS.
 TestDFSIO.java		Validate Read and Write Throughput			
 TestGlobPaths.java	Tests Glob Paths. Needs to be disambiguated from other Glob Tests.		
 TestUrlStreamHandler.java	High level validation of FS Input Streams
